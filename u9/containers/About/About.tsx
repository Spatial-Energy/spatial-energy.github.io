We have achieved this in a matter of a few days correlating weather data with consumption to find big spenders and take action, selecting the less performant buildings where energy transformation investments would make the biggest difference/impact.",

We showed the potential for cost reduction and greener grid imports with the adoption of dynamic tariffs and revenue staking, so that solar PV supported by storage would not only be environmentally friendly but also generate additional streams of revenues through flexibility services.",
